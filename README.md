**Thanks for contributing to The Carpentries Incubator!**
This repository is part of the **Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: The Turing/Crick partnership project**.
This project will facilitate the development of training resources on data science practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid- to late-career biomedical scientists. 
Materials developed through this project will enable (1) a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences and (2) recommendations for managing (as well as supervising and facilitating) open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.

*This is one of the two masterclasses being developed under Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: the Turing/Crick partnership project. For the second masterclass, please visit: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects.*

For details about the project and track management related information, please the [Project Management Repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/).

## The Carpentries Incubator Programme

This repository provides a blank starting point for lessons to be developed here.

A member of the Carpentries Curriculum Team will work with you to get your lesson listed on the Community Developed Lessons page and make sure you have everything you need to begin developing your new lesson.

A member of the [Carpentries Curriculum Team](https://carpentries.org/team/)
will work with you to get your lesson listed on the
[Community Developed Lessons page][community-lessons]
and make sure you have everything you need to begin developing your new lesson.

## What to do next

Before you begin developing your new lesson,
here are a few things we recommend you do:

* [ ] Decide on a title for your new lesson!
  Once you've chosen a new title, you can set the value for `lesson_title`
  in [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
* [ ] Add the URL to your built lesson pages to the repository description\*
* [ ] [Add relevant topic tags to your lesson repository][cdh-topic-tags].
* [ ] Fill in the fields marked `FIXME` in:
  * this README
  * [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
* [ ] If you're going to be developing lesson material for the first time
  according to our design principles,
  consider reading the [Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh]
* [ ] Consult the [Lesson Example][lesson-example] website to find out more about
  working with the lesson template
* [ ] If you are planning to write your lesson in RMarkdown,
  [create a `main` branch and set this as the default branch in your repository settings][change-default-branch]
* [ ] Update this README with relevant information about your lesson
  and delete this section


\* To set the URL on GitHub, click the gear wheel button next to **About**
on the right of the repository landing page.
The lesson URL structure is **https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/<repository-slug\>**:
a repository at https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/new-lesson/ will have pages at
the lesson URL https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/new-lesson/.
