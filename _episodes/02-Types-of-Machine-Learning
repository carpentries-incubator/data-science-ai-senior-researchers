Machine Learning (ML) makes use of data to mprove computing performance on a given set of tasks, whereby ML algorithms are trained on sample data to make predictions or decisions.
Common applications of ML algorithms include email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, while they are also increasingly used for task optimization and efficiency in agriculture and medicine.

Subsets of ML can be grouped into 4 different types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, semi-super-vised and reinformcement learning. 


## Supervised learning

## Semi-supervised learning

### A new era for Large Language Models
Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model

With the release of Chat GPT-3 in early 2023, Large Language Models gained the interest and engagement of the general public and mainstream userbase.


## Reinforcement learning
